# This is the Star-Wars Project, developed at trybe!
## In this project made with React, it was necessary to use Hofs, React Hooks, and tests with RTL
## I chose to create custom hooks. I found the result very interesting
## I also opted for componentization for cleaner code.
## Both the tests and the creation of the filters were great challenges.

# To run the project follow the steps below in your terminal:
## git clone git@github.com:MarceloHcb/star-wars-project.git
## npm installation
## npm start
